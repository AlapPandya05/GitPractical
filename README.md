# GitPractical

## 1. Pull and Merge difference
Pull : If we pull any branch or file in our local repository from any remote repository, the branch or file will be fetched as well as merge to the branch according to our need.

Merge : When we merge any feature branch to master branch all the commits in the feature branch will reflect in the master branch.
